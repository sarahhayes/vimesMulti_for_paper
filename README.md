# **vimesMulti_for_paper**

This repository includes the scripts used to generate the results for the paper 
It uses the *vimesMulti* package which is documented on a separate website. 

The scripts used for the paper are in the *for_paper* folder. The ones beginning with the words 'rerun' are the basic scripts. Of these, the ones ending 'all_assorts' use the Rayleigh distribution for the spatial kernel and those ending 'gamma_spatial' use the gamma distribution for the spatial kernel.
The files entitiled 'bootstrap' are those used to explore the impact of the uncertainty in dates and times on the results. 
Data can be found in the *data* folder.
