## In the feedback to the initial paper, KH suggested that she'd like to see:
##  a) the frequency distributions of minimal distances between cases, versus the pdf of the Raleigh distribution,
##     with the cutoffs indicated, to see the extent to which the algorithm does not link cases -
##     this would make the method (and the applicability to the data) more transparent (to me).
##  b) the distribution of distances to cases where the exact GPS is known vs where there is 5-10 km of uncertainty to see how this is affecting inference.
